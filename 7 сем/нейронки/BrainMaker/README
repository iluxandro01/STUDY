UPDATE TO GETTING STARTED

Note that page 28 of the Getting Started Manual should say: "the minimum
is -2.8 and the maximum is 2.8 so the range is 5.6.  With the training
tolerance of .1, any output that is within plus or minus .56 (range *
tolerance) of the pattern will be considered "Good."

COMPETITOR CORRECTION

On page 16-7 of the manual, the documentation is incorrect. The left column
is the order in which the horses are predicted to finish; the right is the
entry number. On the screen, the columns are labelled incorrectly, also.
The left column should be labelled Predict, the right Entry. The entry number
corresponds to the order in which you entered the horses into your file.

BRAINMAKER NEW FEATURES

Copy and Paste

    Copy and Paste transfer information between BrainMaker and other
    programs.  However, in order for these functions to be most useful, they
    differ in two important ways from the Windows standard for Copy and
    Paste:

    1.  In order to have useful information (the outputs) to put into the
        Windows clipboard, Copy runs facts from the running fact file
        through BrainMaker before copying the outputs to the clipboard.

    2.  Paste actually performs both a paste and copy function, and also
        runs facts through BrainMaker.  When facts are pasted from the
        clipboard into BrainMaker, they are run through the trained network,
        and the output(s) are copied into the Windows clipboard.  Because
        the outputs overwrite the facts copied from the clipboard, it is not
        possible to select Paste twice to repeat pasting facts from another
        application into BrainMaker.

    Details on using Copy and Paste are found in the new pages you received
    for Chapters 10 and 11.

DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange)

    Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) passes information between BrainMaker and
    other programs automatically.  When you link files in different
    applications, DDE exchanges data between them without further user
    involvement.  The drive and path where BrainMaker is located must be
    placed in your path environment variable.  Without it, the linked
    program will be unable to find BrainMaker.

    If you load a trained network which has a link to a file in another
    program, you will be asked if you wish to reestablish the link.  If you
    do, information will automatically be passed between the programs.  If
    you don't wish to reestablish the link, you will need to recreate it in
    BrainMaker at a later time.

    If you create a DDE link to another application, and the other
    application saves the information for the DDE link and restores it when
    reading the document back in, the other application will typically start
    an instance of BrainMaker to perform its DDE calculations.  This
    instance of BrainMaker exists only to process the DDE link and will
    behave improperly if you bring it to the front and attempt to perform
    operations such as training, testing, or running.  If you want to work
    directly with the network being used for a DDE link as described above,
    you should open a separate instance of BrainMaker and work with your
    network there.

    Details on using DDE are found in the new pages you received for
    Chapters 10 and 11.

Test Every N Facts

    A new feature on the Training Control Flow form, Test Every N Facts,
    permits you to test your network during each training iteration.  For
    example, if you have 35 facts in your training file and you set Test
    Every N Facts to 10, BrainMaker will test your network after training
    facts 10, 20, 30 and 35.  (If the number of facts in your training set
    is not evenly divisible by the value you enter, BrainMaker will also
    test at the end of the run.) BrainMaker will use the testing file
    specified on the Select Fact Files dialog box.  Testing statistics will
    be saved if you choose Testing Statistics from the File menu.

    The Network File directive, testruns, now has an optional additional
    parameter.  The new format is as follows:

        testruns [runs] [facts]

    where [runs] allows you to specify the number of training runs to elapse
    before testing, and [facts] specifies the number of facts to pass through
    training during one iteration before testing.  If you specify only the
    first parameter, BrainMaker will test your network at the run interval
    you specify.

STOP TRAINING WHEN

Training Average Error <= N

    BrainMaker will stop training when the Training Average Error is equal
    to or less than the value you specify.

    The new network file directive is

        stoptraining trainavgerr [n]

    where [n] is a value between 0 and 1 indicating the training average
    error at which the network should stop training.

Testing Average Error <= N

    BrainMaker will stop training when the Testing Average Error is equal to
    or less than the value you specify.

    The new network file directive is

        stoptraining testavgerr [n]

    where [n] is a value between 0 and 1 indicating the testing average
    error at which the network should stop training.

Saving the Network Progress Display, deltas, and heuristic learning rate
parameters:

    BrainMaker Professional v3.11 now saves parameters which permit you to
    duplicate exactly results when you continue training a partially-trained
    network.  In previous releases, if, for example, you saved a network at
    run 200 and continued training, testing at run 250, the testing
    statistics might be different than those obtained by loading the network
    saved at run 200 and training to run 250.  This problem has been
    eliminated by saving deltas and additional heuristic learning rate
    parameters.  This requires no action on your part.  However, you will
    notice that your trained network file (filename.net) is now much larger
    than it was, and that there are additional commands in your network file:

        deltas

    ... followed by matrices of letters, to keep track of changes made
    necessary by the Smoothing Rate.

    To exactly duplicate results when saving a partially-trained network,
    you must save the network at the end of a run.  When the partially-
    trained network is loaded, BrainMaker begins at the beginning of the
    run, not at the position in the fact file where the network was saved.

        learnrate [n] auto [n n n]

    The additional numbers following "auto" are used to keep track of
    information for resuming training with the heuristic learning rate.

        stathistory [n]

    keeps track of information needed for the Network Progress Display.

    NOTE: The inclusion of the deltas may increase the saved network size by
    as much as 25%.  If you don't want BrainMaker to save deltas, add the
    following command to the BrainMak.ini file (in your Windows directory):

        nodeltas

NETMAKER NEW FEATURES

    NetMaker's interface has been improved.  A highlight bar is displayed
    above the column or beside the row you have selected.  Clicking a
    selected column or row de-selects it.  The box surrounding the column or
    row label now indicates the position of the cursor, rather than that the
    column or row has been selected.

Importing CSI format files into NetMaker

    You can now import data from CSI into NetMaker.  Choose the CSI format
    when you read in the file.  Instructions are included in the new pages
    you received for Chapter 9.

Write Files Now option in NetMaker

    If you have already declared inputs, patterns, and annotations, you
    can bypass having NetMaker confirm all NotUsed columns by selecting
    Write Files Now from the form that is displayed.  Choosing Cancel
    interrupts the query/write files process.

NetMaker Paste function

    You can now import data from any program by opening the file in that
    program, copying the necessary rows and columns to the Windows
    clipboard, and then selecting Paste from the File menu in NetMaker.
    The data will overwrite any data currently on-screen.  There is
    currently no utility which permits appending data within NetMaker.

NetMaker limits:

    Files can be imported from dBASE III, Excel (through version 3.0), and
    Lotus 1-2-3 (through version 3.0).  The current version of NetMaker
    cannot read Quattro or Paradox files.  However, using the new Paste
    function in NetMaker, you can now import from any data format by copying
    data from that file to the Windows clipboard.  Then select Paste from
    the File menu.  This will overwrite data currently on-screen.

Possible NetMaker graphing incompatibility with Hercules monitors

    If you have a Hercules monitor, you may encounter a problem when
    displaying or printing a graph.  It appears to occur only when plotting
    dashed line-style graphs with extremely sharp peaks.  If you should
    encounter this problem, try dsiplays plotting traces as solid lines
    instead of dashed lines.  If the problem persists, please contact us.

Binary Files:

    BrainMaker Professional and the BrainMaker Toolkit create binary format
    files (with the extensions .bin and .bts) which preprocess fact files to
    speed training.  BrainMaker creates and uses these files automatically;
    you never need to give the name of a binary file to BrainMaker.

    These files are automatically erased and rewritten if you make certain
    changes during training, or if you edit your files.  BrainMaker compares
    the dates of your files to the corresponding binary files.  If the
    binary files have an earlier date or time, BrainMaker will delete and
    recreate them before attempting to train or test.

    To free space on yor disk, you may delete these files when you are not
    in BrainMaker.  You may also add the command "nobinary" to BrainMak.cfg
    (DOS) or BrainMak.Ini (Windows) if you do not wish for BrainMaker to
    create and use binary files.

Specify location of data files
    In order to specify the location where BrainMaker programs will read and
    write files, click on the BrainMaker program icon and, from the Program
    Manager, choose File / Properties.  Enter the drive and path under
    Working Dirctory.  Repeat this step for all other icons in your
    BrainMaker Professional directory.

    Please note that the "datafiles" statement described on page 12-24 of
    your user's manual is used in the DOS version of BrainMaker only.  This
    statement has no function in the Windows version.

Runtime.c

    Runtime.c can be used only with numeric data files.  It cannot be used
    with symbolic or picture data.

    The BrainMaker Professional Runtime system now works with EMS and XMS.
    RuntimeX.obj is the Borland C++ object file which permits you to use EMS
    or XMS memory with Runtime.c.  (The only time you need RuntimeX.obj is
    if your network is large enough to require EMS or XMS memory.) Uncomment
    line 53 (#define EMSXMS) of Runtime.c and link with RuntimeX.obj to use
    EMS/XMS.

    Note: A runtime file which enables you to use EMS or XMS memory with the
    Microsoft compiler will be provided on request.

    Runtime.c is source code intended for a DOS application.  Some
    modification will have to be made to use Runtime.c with a Windows
    application.

Batch Mode Operations

    All batch mode operations run minimized in the background.  When you
    invoke a batch mode operation, you will see a minimized BrainMaker
    icon displayed while the function is being performed.

Random Weight Matrices

    The random seed used under Windows 3.11 varies under different
    conditions.  If you go from Netmaker to BrainMaker, the resulting weight
    matrix will be different than if you load BrainMaker directly from
    Windows.  In order to make tutorials work precisely as described, it is
    important to follow the steps in the tutorials exactly.

Single Step, Pause on Bad Fact

    While running BrainMaker in Single Step or Pause on Bad Fact modes, i.e.
    when the Next Fact button is visible within the BrainMaker window, you
    cannot use Alt + (letter) to activate items in the menu bar.  Instead,
    to choose commands from the menu bar using the keyboard while in either
    of these modes, press and release the Alt key, then press the letter
    corresponding to the desired menu item.  Shortcut keys (e.g. Ctrl + T)
    or the mouse will operate normally in these modes.

Text Editors

    When editing files used by BrainMaker or NetMaker, it is important to
    insure that your editor creates and saves ASCII text files.  Windows
    comes with two editors, NotePad and Write, which you may use to create
    or edit files.  (The SEE editor, referenced in the manual, is not
    provided with the Windows version, because it does not run under
    Windows.)

Assignment of "Hot Keys"

    Windows requires the assignment of certain hot keys.  For this reason,
    some hot key assignments have been changed from earlier versions.  For
    example, exiting BrainMaker or NetMaker is now Alt + X, rather than
    Ctrl + Z.

Customizing colors

    The MenuComp utility is gone.  If you own DOS BrainMaker 3.0, you can
    change colors using the System menu.  The changes will be saved to the
    configuration file.  If you are using the Windows version, use the
    Program Manager to change colors.

Network file directives

    In order to reduce confusion, we now refer to definition file commands
    as "network file directives", because they may be used in both the
    definition and network files.

Converting files from BrainMaker Professional 2.0:

    .Def and .Net files are compatible for versions 2.5 and 3.0. However,
    both .def and .net files have been changed from version 2.0.  The
    utility program NETCNVRT.EXE has been included to convert 2.0 files to
    the new format.  We recommend you create a backup of all your .net and
    .def files before executing the conversion program.

    To run the conversion program, exit to DOS and, from the DOS prompt,
    type:

    netcnvrt <filename>.def
        -or-
    netcnvrt <filename>.net

    NetCnvrt assumes that files ending in .NET are BrainMaker saved network
    files, and that files with other extensions are definition files.  If
    you have a network savefile with a different extension, make a copy with
    the extension .NET and run NetCnvrt on the copy.

    For some definition files, NetCnvrt needs to read (but not change) your
    training fact file.  When running NetCnvrt on a definition file that
    does not include facts, you should include the name of the factfile
    after the definition filename:

    netcnvrt <filename>.def <filename>.fct

    If a definition file contains the training facts, a copy of the facts
    will be placed in the file filename.fct.

    NetCnvrt will rename your existing file to filename.BAK.  For this
    reason, do not run NetCnvrt on any file that already has this extension.
    Once you have successfully converted all your definition and network
    files to 3.0's format, you may safely delete these backup files.

Converting old trained networks from earler versions of Standard BrainMaker
Professional BrainMaker v3.0:

    1.  Using your old version of BrainMaker, read in your trained network
        and write the weights out to a file.

    2.  Copy the old definition file and insert the weights into the file
        after the min/max and before facts.

    3.  Take this definition file over to the Professional v3.0 programs and
        run the netconversion program on it, as described above.
